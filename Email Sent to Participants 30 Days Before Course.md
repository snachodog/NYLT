## Parent Letter

Dear `Parent Name`,

We are less than a couple weeks away from NYLT! Some of you have received information already, but if you were on the waitlist, I apologize that this may be our first interaction.

If your ABC Medical form is out of date, right now, please call your Scout’s medical provider and get an appointment - we must have up to date Med forms received at camp at check in. Please take a look at the Council’s recommended packing list and make your packing plan soon!

Check in starts at 12pm on June 20th. Here is the link to the Google Maps location for Grizzly Base Camp: [https://goo.gl/maps/eXfXNS3AS4EhxdCWA](https://goo.gl/maps/eXfXNS3AS4EhxdCWA). When you arrive, please drive slowly into camp. One of our youth staff will greet you at the gate and direct you where to park and how to get to the camp lodge. Please accompany your Scout to the lodge for medical and check-in. If you have requested extra t-shirts, please have a check made out to the Council, or cash in the amount of t-shirts x $15 (exact change is required) at check-in. For medical check-in, a physical, paper copy of the [ABC Medical Form](https://filestore.scouting.org/filestore/HealthSafety/pdf/680-001_AB.pdf) and that is dated no later than June 26, 2020 is required (photocopies are valid) accompanied by a copy of your medical insurance card. We cannot  and will not accept digital versions of these documents. If you have emailed it to me previously, it is deleted and a physical copy is required in camp. A photocopier is not available in camp, so please come prepared.

As a part of our COVID mitigation plan, after the medical and check-in, parents and guardians should be prepared to leave camp as soon as possible. If you are considering visiting camp, please call me first. Due to heightened COVID restrictions, we’re allowing very few visitors into camp - limited to professional staff.

While cell phones are not disallowed at camp, it is highly recommended that they not be brought. There is very little if any cell service for most carriers, limited power, and no wifi at Grizzly Base Camp. We can’t be responsible for damaged, lost, or stolen electronics, so please, leave them at home.

Our 6 days together will be jam packed! Camp wake up call is in the 6 o’clock hour every morning, and most days lights out is at about 10pm.

When it’s all said and done, our final program is Friday evening, and is slated to end about 8pm. Check out of camp is scheduled for 11am on Saturday, June 26th so that we can properly get camp packed away and buttoned. If you need to have leave Friday evening, please let me know. Unfortunately, if your Scout has to miss any part of the course, National Policy is to not grant a completion certificate, so it is not recommended to plan for your Scout to be gone earlier than the last segment of the training Friday evening. Due to COVID restrictions, there is no “graduation ceremony” in the schedule this year.

On Saturday morning, your Scouts will be ready to meet you at the parking lot of Griz Base to load up and head home. Please, be prompt in picking up your Scouts. Our youth and adult staff have long drives home all over Montana after camp and we want to be courteous of their time, too.

I look forward to meeting you in person on the 20th!

Yours in Good Scouting,

Steve Dogiakos
Scoutmaster, NYLT Troop 2021

## Letter to Scouts

Dear future leaders,

Hello! My name is TJ Higuera. I am an Eagle Scout from troop 1911 and I will be your SPL for the NYLT week! We have a lot planned for you and a very very busy week so rest up now! This course will help you become a successful leader in the future and teach you skills that you can bring back to your troop. My staff has been preparing since December to bring you the best course possible. I am very excited! I believe that this course will be the best course ever. The training and activities that will be presented to you are unparalleled by any course. I will see all of you in five weeks!

Yours in Scouting,

`Johnny Eagle Scout`
Senior Patrol Leader, NYLT 2021
