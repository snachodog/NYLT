This is a repository for me to post docs from my National Youth Leadership Training course. I make no claim to any of Boy Scouts of America's trademark or copyright, and any that this documentation has, I share in the spirit of Fair Use.

My course was held in June of 2021 at Grizzly Base Camp in [Montana Council](http://montanabsa.org/).
