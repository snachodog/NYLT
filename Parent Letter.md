# Letter to Scout Parents
This letter was sent to the parents of eligible Scouts in my Council.

Dear Scout Parent,

I’m Steve Dogiakos, and I have the privilege of being this year’s National Youth Leadership Training (NYLT) course director and would like to take less than 5 minutes of your attention that could make all the difference in your scout’s progression in scouting and in life as well.

Tall order, I know, but the clock is ticking on my 5 minutes!

 NYLT is a lot of things to a lot of different people. Scouts come away from NYLT with the following statements:

* “It’s a blast! I had so much fun. Way more than I thought I would!”
* “That’s why we do it that way.”
* “I learned about how others might look at problem differently”
* “I got so many ideas I can take back to my troop”
* “I didn’t think I could do it but my patrol helped me out so much.”
* “I use what I learned at NYLT in parts of my life outside of scouts. It has definitely helped me to excel in college.”

Pretty intense right?

NYLT takes what the life of a troop would experience in more than a month and compresses it down to 6 days. It is the example of how troops should be run, which is scout-led! It is run by the youth, for the youth because modeling is the quickest and most efficient way to understand youth leadership concepts and practices.

By attending NYLT course this year, your scout will come away with a lot of the following leadership skills:

* Conflict management and resolution
* Recognizing how and when to drive group cohesion and performance
* Understand principles of effective communication
* Gain confidence in getting out in front and speaking in public
* How to function and excel in a pressured situation
* Have the confidence and prepare for situations to be as successful as possible while learning from mistakes

A lot of scouts equate their NYLT experience with High Adventure Programs like Philmont and Boundary Waters. Why? Because they pushed themselves through something which they thought was hard and was rewarded on the other side. All this sounds great right?

As of January 12th, we have only a few available slots left for this year’s NYLT course to get registered. After that we will be placing scouts on a standby list.

You have already witnessed what scouting can do for your scout. Get them setup for more success by getting them registered for our course. You can go out to http://bit.ly/MontanaNYLT to find out more, and get registered at the same time. It will go through dates, things to expect, etc. I am more than happy to answer any questions, my direct email is steve@dogiakos.com.
Thanks for your time and consideration. I look forward to watching your Scout excel this summer!

Yours in Good Scouting,



Steve Dogiakos
Scoutmaster, NYLT Troop 2021
